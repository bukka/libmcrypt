New to Pegwit 9 alfa.04:

+ DLL interface
+ Code cleaned up


New to Pegwit 9 alfa.03:

+ ECC polynomial code replaced with normal basis (onb) code
+ Blowfish replaced with Rijndeal (256 bit for conventional encryption,
  224 bit for public key encryption)
+ SHA1 replaced with SHA256
+ double barreled hashing removed (it was not working properly anyway)
+ commandline now supports keyring file (pegwit.pkr)
+ only one line is used to make secret key
+ much faster


New to Pegwit 9 alfa.02:

+ Nyberg-Rueppel signature replaced with DSA signature
- still very slow


New to Pegwit 9 alfa.01:

+ all old ECC code replaced with Mike Rosing's ECC code
  (http://www.manning.com/Rosing/ http://mendota.terracom.net/~eresrch/ )
+ uses one of curves recommended by NIST F2^233
  (http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/ )
+ Square replaced with Blowfish in CBC mode (160 bit for conventional encryption,
  224 bit for public key encryption)
+ Public keys and signatures now use BASE64 encoding instead of HEX(BASE16) encoding
  so public key now is only 40 character long an signature 80
+ added possibility to encrypt to multiple public keys (encrypt to self)
- very slow
